# Historical Declarations D1 data

- `schema.sql` — D1 schema.
- `seed.sql` — the final archive: 31,095 declarations (2023 and 2024
  published, 2025 draft), 154 companies, 20,315 beneficiaries, 261
  countries, 23 currencies. Generated locally by
  `scripts/build-final-historical-declarations.py` from the legacy
  PostgreSQL dump. Not tracked in Git (see `.gitignore`); counts and the
  source-dump hash are recorded in `seed.sql.validation.json`.
- `seed.sample.sql` — 100-declaration sample with company and
  beneficiary/HCO names replaced by clearly-fake placeholders
  (`... (test data)`), for local testing without real names. Regenerate
  with `python3 scripts/build-sanitized-d1-sample.py`. See that script's
  docstring for what it does and doesn't sanitize (addresses and one
  legacy data-quality outlier still carry real identifying text in a
  few rows).

## Which database am I looking at?

This is the single most common source of confusion, so check it first.

| | local fixture | final archive |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `seed.sample.sql` | `seed.sql` |
| Declarations | 100 | 31,095 |
| Years | **2022**, 2023, 2024 | 2023, 2024, 2025 |
| Lives in | `.wrangler/state/v3/d1/` | Cloudflare D1 `historical-declarations-final` |

**Any 2022 in the year filter means you are on the local fixture.** The
final archive excludes 2022 and earlier by design.

`wrangler dev` uses the local fixture **by default**. The
`database_name` and `database_id` in `wrangler.toml` identify the remote
database only and are ignored in local mode — editing them does not
change what a plain `wrangler dev` serves. Pick the dataset with the
script you run:

```bash
npm install            # once, to install the pinned wrangler
npm run dev:worker         # local fixture, offline, no Cloudflare account
npm run dev:worker:remote  # the real archive on Cloudflare D1
```

Both scripts run `npm run build` first, because the Worker serves the
React app from `dist/` via the `ASSETS` binding — without a fresh build
you get a stale frontend.

## Testing locally against the fixture

`wrangler dev`'s local D1 mode runs entirely offline against a local
SQLite file — no `wrangler login` or real `database_id` required.

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute historical-declarations-final --local --file=d1/historical-declarations/schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute historical-declarations-final --local --file=d1/historical-declarations/seed.sample.sql
npm run dev:worker
```

Then open http://localhost:8787/transparency/historical-declarations.

To reset local state: `rm -rf .wrangler/state/v3/d1` and re-run the two
`wrangler d1 execute` commands above. Note that the local file is keyed
to the `database_id` in `wrangler.toml`, so changing that ID gives you a
fresh empty local database rather than an error.

## Verifying which dataset the app is serving

Use `curl`, not the browser — the browser will happily serve a cached
response and hide the answer.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8787/api/historical-declarations/metadata"
curl "http://localhost:8787/api/historical-declarations/search?year=2022&limit=1"
curl "http://localhost:8787/api/historical-declarations/search?currency=RSD&limit=1"
```

Against the final archive: `metadata` returns years `[2025, 2024, 2023]`,
`year=2022` returns `total: 0`, and `currency=RSD` returns `total: 2`.

`search` caps `total` at `MAX_ACCESSIBLE_RECORDS` (1000) as an
anti-scraping measure, so `year=2024` reports `total: 1000` rather than
10,981. That is expected. Use a narrow filter when you want to check an
exact count against `seed.sql.validation.json` — for example `RSD` (2),
`NOK` (52), `HRK` (68).

## Loading the archive into a remote D1 database

Already done for `historical-declarations-final`
(`cd4e5d0a-0fa1-4aae-94b4-be4aa540adb0`). To rebuild from scratch:

1. `npx wrangler d1 create <name>` and put the returned `database_id`
   into `wrangler.toml`.
2. `npx wrangler d1 execute <name> --remote --file=d1/historical-declarations/schema.sql`
3. `npx wrangler d1 execute <name> --remote --file=d1/historical-declarations/seed.sql`
4. Confirm with
   `npx wrangler d1 execute <name> --remote --command "SELECT year, COUNT(*) FROM declarations GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;"`
