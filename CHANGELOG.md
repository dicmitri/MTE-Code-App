## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added the “Can we support this event?” checker (`/event-support`, Home Hub and the sidebar's Decision Trees group). It was built on the `codex/event-support` branch, which was cut from a `main` 22 commits old; it is ported onto current `main` and rebuilt against the Code:
  - All wording (questions, conditions, reasons, outcomes), the Annex I and Annex VI tables with their verbatim cell text, the sources and the CVS status labels are in `src/data/eventSupportRules.json`. The evaluator (`src/utils/eventSupportRules.js`) returns message and source IDs; `src/utils/eventSupportQuestions.js` asks only questions that can change the result; `src/utils/eventSupportCvs.js` reads CVS statuses. Validation moved from the client bundle to `scripts/validate-data.mjs`, which also checks every “Chapter N, Section N”, “Annex N” and “Q&A N” in the wording.
  - Glossary terms and Code references in the checker are linked like the reader's, and preview in the side panel from 1280px or in the definition dialog below; the Code opens in a new tab so the answers are kept (`linkedTextEvents.js` now holds the handlers shared with `FullTextSection.jsx`; `DefinitionPopup` takes an optional `action` link).
  - The Worker answers `/api/cvs/search` and `/api/cvs/events/:emtId` (`cvs-api.js`, `cvs-adapter.js`, `cvs-parser.js`) by reading the public CVS site; `scripts/check-cvs-live.mjs` checks it against a running Worker. The `/prototypes/cvs` demo page and the `wrangler.toml` `run_worker_first` entry from the branch were not ported.
  - Logic aligned with the Code: Mecomed countries are in the MedTech Europe Geographic Area (only the CVS vetting differs); hybrid Events follow the in-person rules; Virtual Events need no CVS decision and allow no direct support of attendance; binding negative and missing CVS decisions stop the support; grants may not go to travel agencies or individuals, but a travel agency may be paid on the recipient's behalf; identifiable grant beneficiaries rule a grant out; a procedure training that does not qualify is assessed as a conference; answering “No” to a Code requirement changes the outcome. See `docs/event-support.md`, which also lists the interpretations for a content owner to confirm.
  - `tests/eventSupport.test.mjs` covers all 32 Annex I and 16 Annex VI cells and walks every path through the questions checking each answer's consistency; `tests/cvs.test.mjs` runs the CVS modules in the Workers runtime against fixtures.
- Added a deterministic, in-browser search engine with no new dependencies. It indexes every Code provision, official Q&A and Glossary definition (and each Transparency provision and Q&A) and ranks them with BM25F, coverage and proximity.
- Everyday wording now finds the Code's formal wording:
  - word forms (plurals, -ing, -ed), checked against the current text;
  - spelling correction for unknown words;
  - abbreviations in both directions (HCP ↔ Healthcare Professional);
  - Glossary links for rare words (spouse → Guests);
  - a general-English phrasebook (`src/data/search/phrasebook.json`, e.g. doctor → physician, wife → spouse), whose structure `npm run validate:data` now checks.
- Added explained results: type badges, snippets, "Matched:" lines, and notes on expansions, spelling corrections, words that match nothing, and results without every word.
- Added search shortcuts: quoted text matches as an exact phrase (every word in order, small words included, word forms still counting), "Q&A 31" shows that Q&A, a Glossary term shows its definition first, and the last word is completed while typing.
- When a typed word is not in the Code (or the Guidelines), the results say so and list the similar terms searched instead: "“wife” is not in the Code. Showing similar terms that may help: spouse, partner, Guests."
- Added a one-click exact-phrase hint when an unquoted phrase with small words, such as in kind, appears in the text as typed.
- Gave every Code and Transparency Q&A its own deep link (e.g. `/code/ch4#ch4-3-educational-grants-qa-3`); opening one switches Q&As on and scrolls to it.
- Added analytics-ready `mte:search` browser events (`settled`, `select`); nothing is sent or stored.
- Added `?searchDebug=1` to show each result's score, coverage and proximity.
- Added the maintainer tools `npm run search:explain -- "<query>"` and `npm run search:report`; `search:report` also takes `--queries <file.json>` and `--json`.
- Added Historical Declarations (`/transparency/historical-declarations`): search past transparency declarations by company or beneficiary name, filter by year, beneficiary country, company country, type and currency, and open a detail dialog. It is reachable from the Transparency landing page and sidebar, and served read-only by the Worker from a Cloudflare D1 database through `/api/historical-declarations/*`, with a capped result window.
- Added a page description, Open Graph and Twitter sharing tags, `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- Added Version History entries for July 2026 Update 3, August 2026 Update and September 2026 Updates 1 and 2, reconstructed from the Git history, and listed the recent-search, Copy Text and Send a Suggestion features missing from July 2026 Update 2.
- Added a side panel docked to the right edge of the window beside the Code and Transparency reader text from 1280px (`#side-pane` in `DocumentReader.jsx`; `useSidePanelFits.js`). It holds "On This Page" and shows one item at a time, only on request (`ContextPanel.jsx`): a Glossary definition instead of the modal, a cross-referenced chapter, section or Q&A in full, or a search result (new eye button on each result). Esc and × close it and return focus to the opener; "On This Page" shrinks to one line while it is open, and with nothing open the panel says how to use it. The text and the panel scroll separately.
- Added cross-reference links (`utils/crossReferences.js`, `data/referenceIndex.js`). "Chapter 4", "Section 3 of Chapter 4", "Chapter 4, Section 3", "Chapters 1, 2 and 4", "Part 2", "Annex III", "Q&A 3" and, in Transparency publications, "Section 2.2" are linked at render time with real `href`s; numbers are read from the loaded titles. In a Transparency publication, "of the Code" or a number the publication lacks means the Code's chapter. A page never links to itself, and a missing section falls back to its chapter. Nothing in the stored text changes.
- `npm run validate:data` checks every cross-reference and decision-tree citation: unresolved ones are errors, chapter fallbacks are printed as notes (currently two: "section 3 of Chapter 2" in Chapter 1, where Chapter 2 has two numbered sections).
- Decision-tree results preview their cited provision in place ("Reference" expands, with "Open in the Code"), so the tree keeps its answers.
- Added resizable panes (`ResizeHandle.jsx`, `usePaneWidths.js`, `utils/paneWidthUtils.js`). From 1024px the sidebar is docked to the left edge of the window; it and the side panel are resized by dragging their inner edge (col-resize cursor), or by focusing the edge and using the arrow keys (Shift for 64px steps, Home and End for the narrowest and widest). Double-click restores the default width and Esc cancels a drag. Widths are saved in rem in `localStorage` (`mte_pane_widths`) and applied before the first paint. `--sidebar-size` and `--side-pane-size` in `index.css` keep each pane within its limits and the text at least 30rem wide, whatever the window. The handles are `role="separator"` elements with `aria-valuenow` as a share of the window width.
- Added "Line length" (Narrow, 40 × text size; Standard, 52 × text size, the default; Full, filling the space between the panes) and "Side panel" (On / Off) to the `Aa` reading settings; saved settings from before are upgraded with defaults.
- Added a `3xl` breakpoint (150rem, 2400px at the default text size) in `index.css`. Arbitrary `min-[2400px]:` variants are sorted before the named breakpoints and lose to them.
- Added a "Your answers" column to decision trees from 1280px; any earlier answer can be changed from it.
- Added the self-hosted Inter typeface (`@fontsource-variable/inter`, normal and italic); its Latin subset is precached for offline use.
- Added tests for cross-references, saved pane widths and the new reader settings.

### Changed
- Search results are now a ranked list of individual provisions, Q&As and definitions in the sidebar. This replaces the chapter tree with per-chapter match counts and Title / Q&A / Text pills. App-written summaries are listed separately as "not Code text".
- Replaced the Titles / Full Text / Q&As filters with Provisions / Q&As / Definitions type chips.
- The reader now highlights the words that actually matched, including expansions, instead of the literal query.
- Search is rebuilt from the current content on every app load, so Code updates need no search changes.
- Version History has its own top-level "Website" sidebar group, shown in every section, instead of a "Website" part inside The Code. Website pages are left out of the Code landing page and the Code's Previous/Next navigation (`CODE_CHAPTERS` and `WEBSITE_CHAPTERS` in `codeData.js`); the chapter file and its `/code/changelog` route are unchanged.
- Glossary links cover every defined term, including abbreviations, plurals and short names introduced in brackets. Each term links once per section, at its first occurrence, and opens in an accessible dialog.
- Reading settings are remembered between visits, pinch-to-zoom is re-enabled, and teal text uses `#007A86` for AA contrast.
- The Code's Word working copy is rebuilt verbatim from the PDF and checked by a strict verifier; five Code text corrections bring the JSON in line with the published Code.
- Expanded the search phrasebook with Code and Disclosure Guidelines vocabulary. Overlapping rules keep their strongest weight, and validation rejects duplicate sources after normalization and stopword-only phrases.
- A multiword phrasebook source is recognised only in a scope where the phrase or one of its targets occurs; elsewhere its words are searched one by one. Everyday words the expansion had dropped were restored, rules whose targets never occur were repointed, and sentence-specific entries were removed.
- Reader layout: the reading area fills the space between the sidebar and the side panel. Its text is centred and capped at `--reader-measure` (52 × reader font size by default, about 105 characters per line). The side panel's default width follows the window (18–40rem), so the text keeps its place from page to page. Section actions wrap under long titles instead of squeezing them.
- Sidebar: full-width search box, tighter padding, chapter names on up to three lines (full name on hover) instead of an ellipsis, and a default width that follows the window (20–30rem). Below 1024px it is the slide-in menu (was below 768px), header toolbar labels show from 1024px, and `/` opens the menu before focusing search.
- Home shows three section cards per row from 1280px and all five from 2400px, with a smaller heading (`Logo` accepts `size={null}` for class-based sizing). The Code landing page uses four columns from 1536px and five from 2400px; the decision-tree landing page three from 1280px and four from 2400px.
- Quiz setup lists chapters in a grid with the question count and Start button in a sticky column from 1024px, without the inner scrolling box.
- TPPT Checker: from 1440px the agenda and sessions are on the left and the result, questionnaire, outcome and PDF export in a sticky right column.
- From 2400px the root font size is 112.5%, and the landing pages, Quiz setup, TPPT Checker, decision trees and Historical Declarations use more of the width.
- Cross-reference links keep the text's weight with a light underline, and print as plain text.

### Fixed
- On Cloudflare, every CVS search in the event support checker failed with “CVS could not serve the requested page”. The Worker's requests to CVS set `cf.cacheTtl`, which makes Cloudflare cache the page and drop its `Set-Cookie`, so the search POST had no session and CVS redirected it to its login page. Local runtimes ignore `cf`, so the tests and `wrangler dev` passed. The requests now carry no `cf` cache options, and `tests/cvs.test.mjs` checks that.
- The TPPT calculator accepted negative or blank durations and unknown session types, which skewed the percentages; it now refuses them (`valid: false`) and the TPPT Checker asks for a correction instead of showing a result.
- The Annex I decision tree answered direct sponsorship of HCPs as “CVS decision required, direct support generally not permitted”. Annex I says “Not allowed”, whatever CVS decides; the answers now lead to that result, and the tree's result texts were corrected.
- The service worker no longer answers browser navigations to `/api/*` with the app shell.
- Multi-word everyday queries such as "wife travel" or "hospital donation" used to return nothing unless the exact phrase appeared in the text.
- The chapter summary is no longer re-sanitized on every re-render, which cleared any text selected in it.
- Quoted searches ignored small words: "in kind" searched only "kind" and also matched "different kinds of". Phrases now keep their small words.
- Phrasebook phrases with small words collapsed to a single everyday word, so plain queries picked up wrong expansions: "travel cost" also searched "free of charge" and "in kind", because "at no cost" had become "cost". A phrasebook phrase now applies only when typed as a phrase, and a typed phrase counts as present in the text when it appears anywhere.
- Deep links to chapters, Transparency pages, decision trees and the TPPT Checker opened the home page on a first visit. The Worker's app-shell fallback now requests `/` instead of `/index.html`, which the assets binding redirected.
- The TPPT PDF report printed the larger-event answer under the opposite question ("Stand-alone event?"); the screen and the PDF now share one set of question texts. A TPPT chunk that fails to load shows a reload message instead of a blank app.
- Quiz answer icons were white on white, the results badge had no background, and the question-count slider had no label.
- The Historical Declarations API clamps the page size, matches search text literally, ignores whitespace-only text, and returns 404 for malformed ids.
- Every page load downloaded the 1.8 MB `tppt-pdfmake` chunk, and an installed app reloaded offline showed a blank page, because Rollup's shared CommonJS helper landed in that lazy chunk. It now has its own `commonjs-helpers` chunk (`vite.config.ts`); the entry bundle no longer imports any `tppt-*` chunk.
- The app named Inter but never loaded it, so readers saw Helvetica or Arial depending on their system.
- The header toolbar ran off-screen between 768px and 959px, hiding Q&A, Aa and Print.
- Four sidebar buttons combined full width with a left margin and overflowed the sidebar by 8px.
