# The Code App — Developer & Editor Guide

Welcome to the repository for **The Code App** (MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice Reader).

This guide is written specifically for anyone who needs to update the content, change the branding, or tweak the styles, even if you have **never looked at the code before**.

---

## 📁 App Structure Overview

The app is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Cloudflare Workers**. All the important UI files live inside the `src/` (source) folder. The main feature folders under `src/` contain local `README.md` files explaining their purpose; content-only folders such as `src/data/code/` do not.

## ⚙️ 1. Technical Architecture & Key Features

The Code App is a multi-section platform with a custom-built architecture optimized for performance and offline reading.

### 🏠 Multi-Section Architecture

The app is organized into independently navigable **sections**, all accessible from a central **Home Hub**:

- **Home Hub** — A card-based landing page that links to each section.
- **The Code** — The full MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice reader.
- **Transparency** — Standalone transparency publications, initially the Disclosure Guidelines.
- **Decision Trees** — Interactive compliance decision guides based on the Code.
- **Knowledge Quiz** — A testing module that challenges users with randomized multiple-choice questions on selected chapters.
- **Can I support this event?** — Checks one planned form of support (an Educational Grant, booth, payment to an HCP, meal, item, donation and more) against the Code, with a live CVS check for third-party Events, its conditions and sources, and a comparison of other options. See [`docs/event-support.md`](docs/event-support.md).
- **TPPT Checker** — A compliance tool for evaluating whether a medical event qualifies as a Third Party Procedural Training meeting. Parses PDF/Word/text agendas, classifies sessions by type (Hands-on, Streaming, Case Study, etc.), checks the Code's practical-session thresholds, and exports a formatted PDF report.

The currently active section is tracked via `activeSection` state in `App.jsx` (`null` = Home, `'code'`, `'transparency'`, `'trees'`, `'quiz'`, `'tppt'`, or `'event-support'`). Transparency also tracks its active standalone publication in `activeDocumentId`. The `SECTIONS` registry supplies Home Hub metadata; it is not a complete navigation or routing registry. Adding a new section (e.g. "Materials") requires:
1. Adding an entry to `src/config/sections.js` using an icon registered in `src/components/AppIcons.jsx`.
2. Creating the content component.
3. Adding selection handling and a rendering branch in `App.jsx`.
4. Adding URL parsing/building rules and navigation actions in `utils/routeUtils.js` and `hooks/useAppRouting.js`.
5. Adding the desired navigation entry to `Sidebar.jsx`.
6. Adding focused routing tests to `tests/routeUtils.test.mjs`.

### 🧩 URL Routing & State (No React Router)
The app uses readable browser-history routes without adding a routing dependency:

- `/code` opens the Code chapter index.
- `/code/ch1` opens a chapter.
- `/code/ch1#ch1-2-event-location-and-venue` opens an exact Code section using its existing generated section ID.
- `/transparency` opens the Transparency index.
- `/transparency/disclosure-guidelines` opens the Disclosure Guidelines overview.
- `/transparency/disclosure-guidelines/dg-chapter-1#section-id` opens an exact Disclosure Guidelines section.
- `/trees/dt-ch1-event-location`, `/quiz`, `/tppt` and `/event-support` open the other tools.

`useAppRouting.js` keeps `App.jsx` state synchronized with these URLs and responds to browser Back/Forward navigation. Pure parsing and URL construction live in `utils/routeUtils.js`, configured with current content in `config/routes.js`. Previously shared root-hash links such as `/#ch1` and `/#ch1-2-event-location-and-venue` remain supported and are replaced with their canonical URL after loading. This compatibility behavior and every current Code chapter/section, Transparency document/unit/section, and decision-tree route are covered by `tests/routeUtils.test.mjs`.

See [`ROUTING.md`](ROUTING.md) before changing Code chapter IDs, Transparency document or unit IDs, tree IDs, section titles, navigation behavior, or deployment routing.

### 🔍 Dynamic Search Engine
The search box sits at the top of the `Sidebar`. In the Code section, the Home Hub and the other tools it searches the MedTech Europe Code; in the Transparency section it searches the Transparency publications. It intentionally does not search Decision Tree content.

- **Results:** every Code provision (section), official Q&A and Glossary definition is its own result, ranked by relevance (up to 30). Each shows a badge (Provision, Q&A 31, Definition), its location, a snippet with the matched words marked, and a "Matched:" line saying why it matched, e.g. `Matched: Guests (Glossary, for “wife”) · travel`. App-written chapter summaries and publication details are listed after them under "App content — not Code text" (or "Publication details — not Guidelines text").
- **Type chips** filter the list: Provisions / Q&As / Definitions in the Code, Provisions / Q&As in Transparency.
- **Everyday wording:**
  - word forms (plurals, -ing, -ed) are matched only when the shorter word exists in the text, so "hospitality" never becomes "hospital";
  - spelling mistakes in unknown words are corrected;
  - abbreviations work both ways (HCP ↔ Healthcare Professional);
  - a rare word used in exactly one Glossary definition links to that term (spouse → Guests);
  - a general-English phrasebook maps everyday words to formal ones (doctor → physician; wife → spouse).
- **Explanation lines** above the results:
  - a word that is not in the Code, and the similar terms searched instead ("“wife” is not in the Code. Showing similar terms that may help: spouse, partner, Guests.");
  - what else was searched for a word that is in the Code ("Also searching: Healthcare Organisations, … (for “hospital”)");
  - spelling fixes ("Spelling: consultacy → consultancy");
  - words that matched nothing ("No match for “students”…");
  - a notice when no result contains all your words;
  - the tip `Use "quotes" for exact wording.`
- **Shortcuts:**
  - quoted text is an exact phrase: every word in order, including small words such as "in", with no expansions. Plurals and other word forms still count, so `"educational grant"` also finds "Educational Grants", and `"in kind"` matches "In-Kind" but not "kinds of";
  - when an unquoted phrase with small words appears in the text as typed, a one-click hint offers the exact-phrase search ("Looking for the exact phrase? Search "in kind"");
  - "Q&A 31" shows that Q&A, typing a Glossary term shows its definition first, and the last word is completed while typing.
- **Opening a result:**
  - a provision goes straight to its section;
  - a Q&A switches Q&As on and scrolls to it (each Q&A has its own link, e.g. `/code/ch4#ch4-3-educational-grants-qa-3`);
  - a definition opens its pop-up.

  The reader highlights the words that actually matched, including expansions.
- **Zero upkeep:** everything search knows about the Code is recomputed from the current content each time the app loads, so search needs no edits when the Code changes. The only hand-written search file is the general-English phrasebook, `src/data/search/phrasebook.json` (see its [README](src/data/search/README.md)).
- **Performance and privacy:** search runs entirely in the browser with no network requests and no new dependencies. Building the Code index takes tens of milliseconds on a desktop computer and happens once, when the browser is idle; each query then takes a few milliseconds. `mte:search` events (`settled`, `select`) are dispatched on `window` for future analytics, but nothing collects or stores them.
- **Keyboard:** press `/` anywhere to focus the search box, or `Escape` while it is focused to clear it. Recent searches are remembered on Enter or when a result is opened.
- **Maintainer tools:** `npm run search:explain -- "wife travel"` (add `--scope transparency` for the Guidelines) prints how a query is understood and ranked. `npm run search:report` prints the top results for everyday example queries plus a self-retrieval check. In the app, `?searchDebug=1` shows each result's score, coverage and proximity (`?searchDebug=0` turns it off).

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) Offline Capabilities
This app precaches the core reader and application assets via `vite-plugin-pwa` so that previously installed users can open the main app without an internet connection. The emitted Disclosure Guidelines PDF and Annex I CSV template are included in the production service-worker precache. The large TPPT document-processing bundles and PDF worker are deliberately excluded, so the TPPT Checker is not guaranteed to load offline unless the required resources are already available in the browser cache.
- The installation logic relies on the `usePWAInstall.js` hook, which intercepts the browser's `beforeinstallprompt` and shows a custom install button. iOS requires manual installation via Safari's "Add to Home Screen" share action, which the UI explicitly handles.

### ⭐ Bookmarks & History
Users can save specific Code or Transparency sections to a personalized **Bookmarks** group in the sidebar (via `useBookmarks.js`). The app also tracks the last 5 visited Code chapters or Transparency document units under **Recently Viewed** (via `useRecentHistory.js`). Stored identifiers are namespaced by publication so similarly named sections cannot collide. Both are saved silently to `window.localStorage` so they persist without user accounts.

### 🗂️ Collapsible Sidebar Navigation
The sidebar uses a hierarchical, fully collapsible group structure:
- **Home Hub:** Bookmarks and Recently Viewed are expanded by default.
- **Code section:** "The Code" parent group expands automatically, revealing sub-groups (Introductory Chapters, Part 1: The Code, Part 2: Complaint Handling, Part 3: Annexes & Glossary).
- **Transparency section:** The "Transparency" group reveals each registered publication and its reader units.
- **Decision Trees section:** The "Decision Trees" group expands, showing a "Browse Decision Trees" link.
- **Website group:** Pages about the app itself, such as Version History, have their own "Website" group, available in every section. It expands automatically while one of those pages is open.
- **Search mode:** While a search is active, the ranked result list replaces the groups. Their expansion state is left untouched and comes back as it was when the search is cleared.

### 🌳 Decision Trees
Interactive compliance decision guides that let users step through real-world compliance scenarios:
- **Interactive Mode:** Question-by-question flow with contextual help text, path breadcrumb trail, go-back/reset controls, and color-coded outcomes (✅ Compliant, ❌ Non-Compliant, ⚠️ Conditional, ⚖️ Consult Legal). From 1280px the answers are listed beside the question, and any earlier answer can be changed from there. A result's Reference opens the cited provision in place, with a link to it in the Code.
- **Full Tree Visualization:** A flowchart rendering of the entire decision tree, with a legend and highlighted-path support.
- **Cross-linking:** Code chapters that have related decision trees show an inline amber callout with a direct link. Clicking it switches the user from the Code section to the relevant tree.

### 📚 Glossary & Definitions
The Code glossary is shared by the Code and Transparency publication readers. Whenever a defined term appears in legal text or official Q&A questions and answers, the existing words become interactive links; clicking one opens a `DefinitionPopup` with the glossary definition. On wide screens (from 1280px) the definition appears in the side panel beside the text instead (`ContextPanel`), unless the reader turns the side panel off in the `Aa` panel. This instrumentation adds no visible wording and does not alter the approved publication text. The Knowledge Quiz remains a separate testing interface and does not apply glossary instrumentation.

### 📑 Reading Utilities
To facilitate heavy professional reference usage, the app includes several quality-of-life tools:
- **Table of Contents (On This Page):** A scroll-tracking list of the page's sections at the top of the side panel on wide screens.
- **Reading Progress Line:** A sticky top progress bar that smoothly tracks scrolling completion down long legal chapters.
- **Q&A Fast-Jump Badges:** Section titles with associated Q&As feature a `💬 Q&A` badge that smooth-scrolls directly to the guidance notes for that provision.
- **Multi-Format Citation and Link Dropdown:** A `[Cite/Link]` popover offering Formal Citations (including section title and current access date), Markdown links, and Direct URL links with confirmation toast notifications.
- **Next/Prev Navigation:** Large footer buttons at the bottom of every reader unit allow for linear reading without returning to the sidebar.
- **Reader Settings:** An `Aa` button in the header opens a panel to customize font size, line spacing, paragraph spacing, line length (Narrow, Standard or Full) and the side panel (On or Off).
- **Line Length:** The text is centred in the reading area and stops at 40 (Narrow) or 52 (Standard, the default) times the chosen text size, about 80 or 105 characters per line; Full fills the space between the panes.
- **Resizable Panes:** From 1024px the sidebar is docked to the left edge of the window and, on Code and Transparency pages from 1280px, the side panel to the right edge. Drag a pane's inner edge to widen or narrow it, or focus the edge and use the arrow keys; double-click it to restore the default width. Widths are remembered, and the text always keeps at least 30rem.
- **Cross-References:** References such as "Chapter 4" or "Section 3 of Chapter 4" become links when the text is displayed. On wide screens they preview in the side panel; elsewhere they open the referenced section. `npm run validate:data` reports any reference that does not resolve.

### 🖨️ Print & Export Mode
The app features an optimized Print Mode. By pressing the **Print** icon in the header (or pressing `Ctrl+P`), the `index.css` `@media print` query strips away the Sidebar, Header, and interactive elements. It presents a clean, high-contrast, black-and-white view of the legal text — perfect for generating PDFs. Transparency printing includes every publication Q&A even when Q&As are hidden on screen; the non-normative Annex I CSV preview and interactive source/download controls are omitted.

### 🛠️ Decap CMS & Cloudflare Worker Integration
The application uses **Decap CMS** for content management, accessible at `/admin/`.
- The CMS uses GitHub as its backend.
- The hosted CMS uses the separately deployed `oauth-proxy.js`, configured by `public/admin/config.yml`, for GitHub OAuth.
- `server.js` serves the static React application and SPA routes. It also contains optional same-origin OAuth endpoints, but it is not the OAuth service currently named by the hosted CMS configuration.
- For local, uncommitted content, run `npm run cms` from the app root. This
  starts both Vite and the local Decap proxy. The hosted CMS continues to read
  only the GitHub `main` branch.
- See [`docs/cms-guide.md`](docs/cms-guide.md) for the non-technical editing,
  validation, troubleshooting, and release workflow.

---

## 📝 2. How to Edit & Add Legal Content (`FULL_CODE_DATA`)

You can edit content directly in the JSON files or via the **Decap CMS** at `/admin/`.

For local CMS editing, use `npm run cms`, not only `npm run dev`. The local proxy is what allows the CMS to read files that have not yet been committed to GitHub.

The text, annexes, and Q&As are stored as **one canonical JSON file per chapter** in:
👉 **`src/data/code/`**

The filename matches the chapter ID and URL. For example, `ch1.json` supplies `/code/ch1`, while `annex4.json` supplies `/code/annex4`.

### Published Baseline and Word Amendment Workflow

The September 2024 PDF and editable Word file have distinct roles:

- `src/data/code-september-2024 (1).pdf` is the hash-pinned published baseline.
- `src/data/code-september-2024.docx` is the team-facing amendment and review format.
- `src/data/code/*.json` remains the source used by the application.

The DOCX is generated directly from the PDF by `scripts/build-code-docx-from-pdf.py`; the script deliberately does not read the JSON. Do not regenerate the DOCX from application data. When a revised DOCX is returned after review, identify the deliberate Word changes against the PDF-derived structure and apply only the approved changes to the relevant chapter JSON files.

Use `scripts/verify_code_docx_against_pdf.py` to check the Word file against the published PDF word for word. Case, punctuation, spacing, superscript footnote references, Q&A labels and bullets must all match; the only accepted wording differences are the corrections listed in the DOCX's editorial correction record. Both scripts need `pip install pdfplumber python-docx`.

Run `npm run verify:code-docx` to compare the source-backed text in all 22 Code
chapter JSON files with the revised Word working copy. The project command uses
the existing Mammoth dependency and checks exact words, punctuation, case,
numbers, and apostrophes; it ignores HTML layout, bullet glyphs, images, and the different presentation of
Q&A labels. A failure is a reconciliation report, not permission to change
either source: review every reported difference and document any approved
exception before updating normative text. Add
`-- --report code-docx-review.md` to produce a numbered Markdown checklist in
which each candidate can be marked `keep app`, `keep Word`, or
`structural difference`.

`src/data/code-manifest.json` is frozen evidence of the 2026 monolith-to-chapters migration. It is not an everyday content baseline and must not be regenerated after an ordinary approved content edit. See [`docs/content-migration/README.md`](docs/content-migration/README.md) and its reconciliation record for the audit history.

### Understanding the Chapter Schema
Each chapter file in `src/data/code/` contains a single JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "ch1",
  "part": "part1",
  "title": "General Criteria for Events",
  "icon": "1",
  "summary": "A brief summary of the chapter goes here...",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "1.1 The Core Objective",
      "legalText": "<p>This is the actual legal text. It uses <strong>HTML</strong> tags.</p>",
      "qas": [
        {
          "q": "What is the core objective?",
          "a": "<p>The answer goes here.</p>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Reference:
* `id`: Unique string identifier (e.g. `"ch1"`, `"annex1"`). Forms the public URL path `/code/<id>`.
* `part`: Categorizes where the chapter appears in the sidebar hierarchy:
  * `"intro"` — Introductory Chapters (Scope, Admin, Intro)
  * `"part1"` — Part 1: MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice
  * `"part2"` — Part 2: Dispute Resolution Code / Complaint Handling
  * `"part3"` — Part 3: Procedural Standards & Annexes
  * `"website"` — Pages about the app itself, such as Version History. They appear in the sidebar's own "Website" group, not under The Code, and are left out of the Code landing page and the Code's Previous/Next navigation.
* `title`: Full title string displayed in headers and sidebar navigation.
* `icon`: Icon name from `AppIcons.jsx` or a chapter number string (e.g. `"1"`).
* `summary`: Short summary string or HTML rendered on chapter cards and summary views.
* `sections`: Array of section objects, each containing:
  * `title`: Section heading (e.g. `"1.1 The Core Objective"`).
  * `legalText`: Normative legal body text (supports HTML tags like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<table>`).
  * `qas`: Array of Q&A objects `[{ "q": "...", "a": "..." }]`.

---

### How to Edit Existing Content
1. **Fixing Typos:** Open the relevant file in `src/data/code/`, use `Ctrl+F` (or `Cmd+F`) to find the text, and change only the intended value. Alternatively, edit via Decap CMS.
2. **Formatting Text:** The `legalText` and `a` (answer) fields support standard HTML:
   - Use `<strong>text</strong>` for bold text.
   - Use `<em>text</em>` for italics.
   - Use `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` for bulleted lists.
   - Use `<table>...</table>` for tabular data.
3. **Adding a Q&A to a Section:** Navigate to the target section in its chapter JSON file, locate its `"qas"` array, and append a new entry:
   ```json
   {
     "q": "Q&A 3: Can a Member Company...?",
     "a": "<p>Yes, provided that...</p>"
   }
   ```

---

### How to Add a New Section to an Existing Chapter
1. Open the relevant chapter file in `src/data/code/` (e.g. `src/data/code/ch1.json`).
2. Add a new section object to the `"sections"` array:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "1.3 Virtual & Hybrid Event Guidelines",
     "legalText": "<p>When organizing virtual events, Member Companies must...</p>",
     "qas": []
   }
   ```
3. *Note on Section Deep Links:* Section IDs are automatically computed from the `title` string via `utils/textUtils.js` (e.g. `"1.3 Virtual & Hybrid Event Guidelines"` generates anchor ID `ch1-1-3-virtual-hybrid-event-guidelines`).

---

### How to Add a Brand New Chapter (Step-by-Step)

When introducing a new chapter (e.g. `ch11.json` or `annex8.json`), follow these 4 steps:

#### Step 1: Create the JSON file in `src/data/code/`
Create a new file `src/data/code/ch11.json` with the complete chapter schema:
```json
{
  "id": "ch11",
  "part": "part1",
  "title": "Digital & Software Compliance",
  "icon": "11",
  "summary": "Guidelines governing standalone software, digital tools, and AI solutions.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "11.1 Scope of Digital Tools",
      "legalText": "<p>This chapter applies to all digital applications...</p>",
      "qas": []
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Register the Chapter Order in `src/data/codeOrder.js`
Open `src/data/codeOrder.js` and add the new chapter ID to the `CODE_CHAPTER_IDS` array in the exact position you want it to appear in linear reading order:

```javascript
// src/data/codeOrder.js
export const CODE_CHAPTER_IDS = Object.freeze([
  'scope',
  'admin',
  'intro',
  'ch1',
  // ...
  'ch10',
  'ch11', // <--- Insert new chapter ID here
  'part2',
  'glossary',
  // ...
]);
```

#### Step 3: Register the Import in `src/data/codeData.js`
Open `src/data/codeData.js`, import your new JSON file, and add it to the `CHAPTERS_BY_ID` dictionary:

```javascript
// src/data/codeData.js
// 1. Add import statement at top:
import chapter11 from './code/ch11.json';

// 2. Add to CHAPTERS_BY_ID mapping:
const CHAPTERS_BY_ID = {
  // ...
  ch10: chapter10,
  ch11: chapter11, // <--- Map ID to imported object
  part2,
  // ...
};
```

#### Step 4: Validate & Verify
Run the validation and test suite from your terminal:
```bash
npm run validate:data
```
Or run the complete verification check:
```bash
npm run check
```
`npm run validate:data` checks JSON structure, registered icons, references, and generated-ID uniqueness. `npm run check` additionally runs route tests, Disclosure source verification, TypeScript checks, and the production build.

See [`docs/content-migration/README.md`](docs/content-migration/README.md) for PDF audit history and migration details.

### Disclosure Guidelines source and editing rules

The Disclosure Guidelines are a standalone publication under the Transparency section, not another Code chapter.

- `src/data/mte-code_disclosure_guidelines.pdf` is the authoritative October 2025 source.
- `src/data/transparency/` contains the verbatim reader data, ordered as Preamble, Chapters 1–3, and Annexes I–III.
- The PDF table of contents is represented by the live document overview and sidebar navigation; normative body text, headings, Q&As, notes, and tables must remain verbatim.
- Footnote 1 in Chapter 1, section 1 keeps its original marker and wording but is intentionally rendered at the end of the continuous-reader section. The source verifier restores only that footnote's PDF-page position for comparison and pins the relocation as an approved representational change.
- `src/data/declaration-csv-template.csv` is the local Annex I download. The sentence and link text remain exactly as published, while the link target is resolved locally by the app.
- The CSV preview is a clearly labelled convenience view of that same local file. It is not part of the published Disclosure Guidelines text.

Never summarize, silently correct, or bulk-reserialize this publication. After any edit, run:

```bash
npm run verify:disclosure-guidelines
npm run validate:data
```

The first command pins both supplied source files and all raw publication JSON. It compares the ordered visible body from PDF pages 2–15 with the integrated publication, checks lexical word boundaries and punctuation, and separately asserts the Annex I link boundary plus Annex II/III structure. The evidence manifest records the narrow PDF-extraction normalizations used for this comparison; they do not change the publication text rendered by the app.

If a formally revised publication is approved, independently reconcile the new PDF/CSV and reader data, then update `source-manifest.json` and the `EXPECTED` baselines in `scripts/verify-disclosure-guidelines.mjs` together in the same reviewed change. Never change expected values merely to make a failure pass.

### Adding another Transparency publication

Transparency is a publication registry, so adding a document requires more than adding a Home Hub card:

1. Create a publication folder under `src/data/transparency/`. Its `document.json` needs a route-safe `id`, title, registered icon, ordered `unitIds`, and declared resources. Each unit needs an `id`, matching `documentId`, `type`, title, a registered icon or numeric icon, positive `sourcePages`, and non-empty `sections`.
2. Import and register the document and its units in `src/data/transparency/transparencyData.js`.
3. Register the same files in `scripts/lib/transparency-content.mjs` so validation and route tests load the live publication data.
4. Map bundled source and resource files in `src/components/TransparencyContent.jsx`. Use `?url&no-inline` for small downloads that must remain real URLs. Offline precaching also requires the file extension in `vite.config.ts` `workbox.globPatterns` and the emitted file to remain below `maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes`; update or explicitly document those limits for other formats and confirm the result in the built `dist/sw.js`.
5. Add source-specific verification where the publication is normative, then run `npm run check` and test every document, unit, and section route.

The generic Transparency landing page, sidebar, reader, search, bookmarks, history, and route builders then include the registered publication without a new section controller.

## 🌳 3. How to Edit Decision Trees (`treeData.json`)

All decision trees are stored in:
👉 **`src/data/treeData.json`**

### Understanding the Structure
Each tree is an object with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "dt-ch1-event-location",
  "title": "Is My Event Location Compliant?",
  "relatedChapter": "ch1",
  "relatedSection": "ch1-2-event-location-and-venue",
  "category": "events",
  "description": "Assess whether a proposed event location meets Code requirements.",
  "nodes": [ ... ]
}
```

### Supported `outcome` values:
| Value | Color | Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compliant` | Green | ✅ | Passes the compliance check |
| `non-compliant` | Red | ❌ | Fails the compliance check |
| `conditional` | Amber | ⚠️ | Depends on further context |
| `consult-legal` | Blue | ⚖️ | Seek legal counsel |
| `not-required` | Teal | ℹ️ | Assessment not required |
| `out-of-scope` | Purple | ➖ | Outside the Code's scope |
| `not-applicable` | Purple | ➖ | Not applicable |
| `prior-review` | Purple | 📋 | Prior review required |
| `in-scope` | Indigo | 🎯 | Within the Code's scope |

### How to add a new tree:
1. Open `treeData.json` (or use Decap CMS).
2. Add a new object to the top-level array.
3. Give it a unique `id` starting with `dt-`.
4. Set `relatedChapter` to the Code chapter's `id` (e.g. `"ch3"` for Company Events).
5. Optionally set `relatedSection` to a specific section's `computedId` for precise cross-linking.
6. Add your `nodes` array. The first question node **must** have `"id": "start"`.
7. Make sure every `"next"` value in every option points to a valid node `id`.

## 🧠 4. How to Edit the Knowledge Quiz (`quizData.json`)

All quiz questions and options are stored in:
👉 **`src/data/quizData.json`**

### Understanding the Structure
Each question is an object with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "q1",
  "chapterId": "ch1",
  "question": "What is the minimum required duration for...?",
  "options": [
    { "id": "opt1", "text": "4 hours", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "opt2", "text": "6 hours", "isCorrect": true }
  ],
  "hint": "The program must present a clear schedule...",
  "explanation": "The minimum duration for a full day is 6 hours..."
}
```

## 🏗️ 5. How to Add a New Top-Level Section

The app is designed to be scalable. Adding an entirely new top-level section (like "Materials" or "Training") requires minimal changes:

1. **Register the section** in `src/config/sections.js`:
   ```js
    {
      id: 'materials',
      title: 'Materials',
      subtitle: 'Supplementary compliance resources',
      description: 'Download templates, checklists, and reference guides.',
      icon: 'Gift',
      color: '#8b5cf6',
      available: true,
    }
    ```

   The icon must already be registered in `src/components/AppIcons.jsx`. If you want to use another Lucide icon such as `Package`, add it to that registry first.

2. **Create the content component(s)** in `src/components/` (e.g. `MaterialsContent.jsx`).

3. **Wire it into `App.jsx`:**
   - Import the component.
   - Recognize `'materials'` in `handleSectionSelect`.
   - Add a conditional branch in the main rendering logic:
      ```jsx
      ) : activeSection === 'materials' ? (
       <MaterialsContent ... />
     ) : (
     ```

4. **Add the section's URL rules** to `utils/routeUtils.js`, expose its navigation action from `hooks/useAppRouting.js`, and add focused cases to `tests/routeUtils.test.mjs`.

5. **Add Sidebar navigation explicitly** in `Sidebar.jsx`. The Home Hub reads available cards from `SECTIONS`, but the Sidebar does not currently generate top-level navigation from that registry.

6. **Run `npm run check`** to validate data, tests, TypeScript, and the production build.

## 🎨 6. How to Edit Styles and Colors

This app uses **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for most component styling. Cross-cutting behavior—including reader typography, CMS-authored HTML, accessibility helpers, animations, and print rules—also lives in `src/index.css`.

### Where to find styles:
If you want to change how a specific part of the app looks, you need to find its corresponding component in the `src/components/` folder.

For example, to change the top navigation bar, open `src/components/Header.jsx`. You will see code like this:
```jsx
<header className="h-20 flex-none border-b border-gray-200 bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm">
```
- `h-20` means height: 5rem.
- `border-b` adds a bottom border.
- `bg-white/95` makes the background white at 95% opacity.
- `backdrop-blur-sm` adds a subtle blur for a glassmorphism effect.

### How to change colors:
Tailwind has a built-in color palette. If you want to change a blue button to a purple button, you simply change `bg-blue-600` to `bg-purple-600`.
- Text color: `text-slate-800`, `text-red-500`, etc.
- Background color: `bg-slate-100`, `bg-teal-50`, etc.
- *Tip: You can find all available colors at [tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).*

### Brand colors used in the app:
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Purple | `#7654A1` | Primary accent (buttons, active states, bookmarks) |
| Teal | `#0099A7` | Code and Transparency reader accent (breadcrumbs, citations, links) |
| Amber/Orange | `#e67e22` | Decision Trees section accent |
| Slate Gray | various | Text, backgrounds, borders |

### Global Styles:
If you need to change the **font family** or the background color of the entire website, look in:
👉 **`src/index.css`**

The Inter typeface is bundled with the app from the `@fontsource-variable/inter` package (imported in `src/main.jsx`), so it needs no third-party font request and works offline. Its Latin files are precached by the service worker (see `vite.config.ts`).

---

## 🖼️ 7. How to Edit Logos and Icons

### The Main Logo
The main MedTech Europe logo (seen in the Header and on the Home Hub) is controlled by a single file:
👉 **`src/components/Logo.jsx`**

### Other Icons
The icons used in the sidebar and throughout the app are stored in:
👉 **`src/components/AppIcons.jsx`**

This file uses a library called `lucide-react`. If you want to change an icon, you can go to [lucide.dev/icons](https://lucide.dev/icons), find the name of the icon you want, and update it in `AppIcons.jsx`.

> **Important:** All icons must be imported through `AppIcons.jsx`. Do not import `lucide-react` directly in other components — this keeps the bundle size predictable and icons consistent.

## ⌨️ 8. Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `/` | Focus the search bar (opens the menu first on phones and tablets) |
| `Escape` | Clear the search bar while the search field is focused; close the side panel while it has focus; cancel a pane resize while dragging |
| `←` / `→` | Resize the focused pane edge (`Shift` for bigger steps; `Home` / `End` for the narrowest and widest) |
| `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` | Open print mode |

## 🚀 10. How to Preview and Publish Your Changes

Once you have made your edits, you'll want to see them and publish them.

### To preview on your computer:
1. Open your terminal in the project folder.
2. Run `npm install` (you only need to do this once, or after dependency changes).
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Open the `http://localhost:3000` link provided in the terminal. The app will automatically update as you save files!

### To build a production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```
The optimized output will be placed in the `dist/` folder. This is what gets deployed.

### To publish to Cloudflare Workers (Live Website):
This project is configured as a Cloudflare Worker with Assets (`wrangler.toml`).
If the Cloudflare project has been separately connected to this GitHub repository with automatic deployments enabled, push your changes:
1. Save your files.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed here"
   git push
   ```
3. Confirm the deployment in Cloudflare. A push triggers deployment only when that external Git integration is configured and enabled; `wrangler.toml` alone does not create a push-triggered deployment.
Alternatively, you can manually deploy using `npx wrangler deploy`.

### Other useful commands:
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Create a production-optimized build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run clean` | Delete the `dist/` folder (the current script requires a shell that provides `rm`; in PowerShell use `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist`) |
| `npm run lint` | Run TypeScript checks without emitting files |
| `npm run validate:data` | Check Code, Transparency, tree, and quiz data integrity |
| `npm run verify:code-docx` | Compare the app's source-backed Code text with the pinned revised Word copy |
| `npm run verify:disclosure-guidelines` | Verify verbatim Disclosure Guidelines data and pinned PDF/CSV sources |
| `npm run verify:production-disclosure-assets` | After a build, prove the emitted Disclosure PDF/CSV remain byte-exact and precached |
| `npm test` | Run focused tests for stable project logic |
| `npm run check` | Run validation, source verification, tests, TypeScript, the production build, and emitted-asset proof |

For step-by-step instructions written for non-technical maintainers, see [`PROJECT_CHECKS.md`](PROJECT_CHECKS.md).

## 🔒 12. Security Notes

- All HTML in `legalText` and Q&A answers is sanitized through **DOMPurify** before rendering. This prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) even if someone injects malicious code into the JSON content.
- The hosted Decap CMS uses the separately deployed `oauth-proxy.js`; `server.js` serves the application and also offers optional same-origin OAuth endpoints. Both OAuth implementations use HMAC-signed state tokens for CSRF protection.
- Public reader interactions and TPPT source documents are processed client-side. Bookmarks, history, and recent searches stay in `localStorage`; the separate `/admin/` CMS communicates with GitHub and its OAuth service when editors sign in or save content. Search runs entirely in the browser, and search events are not sent or stored anywhere.
